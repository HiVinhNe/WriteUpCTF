"""
Public 5MF Generator for the 5D Printer Challenge

This script reads the flag from standard input and generates a scrambled 5MF file.
The commands are intentionally output in a random order so that the correct ordering
must be recovered by sorting by the extra dimensions.

The printer is “5D” because, in addition to X, Y, and Z (only printing the first layer --> Z=0),
each command carries:
    U = (subpath_index * 100) + (t * 100)
    V = 50 * sin(2*pi*t)
where t is the normalized progression along that command segment.

# Generate a vector outline from the provided flag text.
# Group the vertices into subpaths (each starting with MOVETO)
# list to store each command (dict with keys: code, X, Y, Z, U, V)
# first command, distance is zero
# t goes from 0 to 1 along the subpath. (When tot==0, t remains 0.)
# Unique twist: use subpath index so that commands from later subpaths always have higher U.
# V is a cyclic parameter (represents, a material property over time).
# Z is maintained 0 for a 2D layer.
# Write out in a custom 5MF format.
# Use G5D_MOVE for MOVETO commands, G5D_DRAW otherwise.
